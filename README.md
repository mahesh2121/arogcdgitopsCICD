Develop and version your Flask application code using Git. You can use a Git repository to store and manage your Flask application's source code.

Define your application's desired state using Kubernetes manifests. You can use Argo CD's declarative approach to specify the desired state of your Flask application by defining Kubernetes manifests such as Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources.

Configure Argo CD to monitor your Git repository. Argo CD can be set up to continuously monitor your Git repository for changes. When changes are detected, Argo CD automatically reconciles the desired state of your application with the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster.

Make changes to your Flask application. Whenever you need to make changes to your Flask application, such as adding new features or fixing bugs, you make those changes in your Git repository.

Git push triggers the CI/CD pipeline. When you push the changes to the Git repository, it triggers your CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline can include steps such as building the application, running tests, and generating container images.

Argo CD deploys the updated application. As part of the CI/CD pipeline, Argo CD picks up the changes from the Git repository and deploys the updated Flask application to the Kubernetes cluster. Argo CD ensures that the desired state specified in the Git repository is applied to the cluster.

Monitor and manage the deployed application. Argo CD provides a web-based UI and CLI tools to monitor and manage the deployed Flask application. You can track the deployment status, view logs, roll back changes, and perform other management tasks.
